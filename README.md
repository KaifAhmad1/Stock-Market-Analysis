# HDFC Bank Opening Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the opening stock prices of HDFC Bank using time series analysis and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The dataset includes historical stock data with features such as date, opening price, high, low, volume, etc.

## Technical Overview

### Data Exploration
- Loaded HDFC stock data from a CSV file, focusing on 'Date' and 'Open' columns.
- Explored data properties, checking for missing values and conducting basic statistical analysis.

### Data Preprocessing
- Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format.
- Scaled 'Open' prices using Min-Max scaling.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Created windowed datasets for LSTM input sequences.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distribution and outliers with histograms and boxplots.
- Plotted the temporal evolution of opening stock prices.
- Conducted seasonal decomposition to analyze trends, seasonality, and residuals.

### Model Architecture
- Constructed a sequential LSTM model with dropout layers.
- Implemented a learning rate scheduler for adaptive optimization.
- Utilized the Huber loss function for robustness against outliers.

### Model Training
- Trained the LSTM model using windowed datasets.
- Implemented early stopping based on a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) threshold.
- Applied a learning rate scheduler for adaptive optimization.

### Model Evaluation
- Monitored training and testing loss trends over epochs.
- Observed MAE dynamics during training, ensuring convergence.
- Early stopping occurred as the model's MAE reached below 10% of the data scale.

## Conclusion
- The LSTM model exhibits early stopping, indicating effective forecasting.
- Recommends further validation through diverse metrics and comparative analyses.
- Highlights potential areas for model refinement and optimization.
